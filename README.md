# Flow tuples tracing using XDP and BPF

This is a simple example of how to use the BPF XDP program to trace a flow using the XDP program. The program will trace the flow and print the tuple information. 
The sample exercise is meant as an experiment to utilize redbpf to load a BPF program into the kernel and then use the XDP program to trace a flow.
